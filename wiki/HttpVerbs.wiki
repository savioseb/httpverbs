A developer tool to make requests to a ReST based Web Application, also allowing storage of the request as well as the response. <p>

It was surprising that one couldn't really find a developer tool to test ReST calls! The only tool was Url Params Plugin for FireFox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1290/). However, if you are testing your application, you really can't repeatedly type the url and the parameters into the plugin. Moreover, it would be great to use the entire repertoire of HTTP Verbs.

= Http Verbs =
  * *GET* - to get information
  * *POST* - to post new information to the web application
  * *PUT* - to update information of a particular resource
  * *DELETE* - to delete
